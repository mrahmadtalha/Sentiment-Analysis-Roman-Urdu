# Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning for Roman Urdu

## Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying text written in Roman Urdu into positive or negative sentiments using machine learning. With the rise of digital communication, sentiment analysis has become crucial in understanding public opinions, especially in non-Latin languages like Roman Urdu, which pose unique challenges for NLP models.

## Project Structure
- **Data Collection**: Data is collected from social media platforms (e.g., YouTube, Facebook, Twitter) with at least 5000 comments for training and testing.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles data cleaning, normalization, noise removal, and stop words elimination.
- **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF, Unigrams, Bigrams, and N-Grams are used to extract features.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Data is split into 75% training and 25% testing, using multiple classifiers like Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
- **Confusion Matrix and Accuracy**: Compares accuracy across models to evaluate the best classifier for Roman Urdu sentiment analysis.

## Functional Requirements
1. **Data Collection**
2. **Data Preprocessing**
3. **Feature Extraction**
4. **Train/Test Split**
5. **Model Selection and Training**
6. **Confusion Matrix Creation**
7. **Accuracy Evaluation**

## Tools and Techniques
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Environment**: Anaconda (Jupyter Notebook)
- **Techniques**: Machine Learning, NLP (TF-IDF, N-Grams)

## Prerequisites
- Knowledge in **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, and **Natural Language Processing**.
- Familiarity with Python and data preprocessing steps.
